Hi Everybody! My name is Tomasz. I'm very much into 'information technology'. I love to 'design' features with 'productivity' and 'user experience' focus. I enjoy creating 'effective architecture' setups for complex environments. I'm very much into 'cybersecurity', always curious and eager to learn from both 'blue' and 'red' perspectives. I'm keen on 'just going out there and talking to people' ... like a lot. 
I do 'run marathons' and I do enjoy practicing other sports. I love 'going places' and breathe 'different cultures and languages'. I'm interested in everything around 'civil aviation'. I'm happy whenever I can 'teach you something'. Even more if you find it useful, fun ... or both.
